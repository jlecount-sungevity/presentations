# API Testing in Python#

---
# What We Will Accomplish
* Brief overview of python API testing framework goals
* Brief overview of what is a REST API?
* Before you begin...
* Jumping in: generating a test
* Filling In The Blanks
* Running the Test
* Committing and Pushing to github
* Tracking results in ATAT and Jenkins

---
# Goals
* Simple syntax for writing API tests
* Integrates with genuser and salesforce
* Runs on docker or locally
* Runs against any test env or prod
* Skeleton test generator for getting started
---
# What is a REST API?
---
# REST Is About the Nouns
* Representational State Transfer is what it actually stands for
* Not the best name
* Basically provides Create / Read / Update / Delete verbs on Resources (our nouns)
---
# Examples:
---

<br><br>
```python
GET /v2/quote/1234
```

* READ action:  return quote with ID 1234
* GET should NEVER trigger a change to the resource
* Doing 2 GETs should always give you the same result
* (presuming nobody else modified the resource you're getting!)
---
<br><br>
```python
POST /pet
    body={'name' : 'Fido', 'type' : 'cute' }
```

* CREATE action.  Add a new resource.  Takes post params to specify the data
* Does not provide ID numbers -- that's dictated by the service, but the response is likely to contain the created pet.
---
<br><br>
```python
PUT /pet
        body={'id' : 999, 'new_name' : 'Sparky' }
```

* UPDATE action.  Updates existing resource.  Takes post param 'body' to specify the data
* Usually will provide an ID to identify what's to be updated
---
<br><br>
```python
DELETE /pet/999
```

* DELETE action.  Deletes your pet. :-(
* Requires an ID in the endpoint, usually, to identify
---
# Using This Information with our python test framework...
---
# Before you begin...
* What are you attempting to test?  Is there a spec?  RAML?
* Test class name
* Test methods.  What are they validating?
* Think through your test cases, but don't  put them in testrail!
---
# Back to RAML...
* RAML is what we use for specifying our API behavior
* It is the definitive truth.
* Some level of the code probably was generated from the RAML
* Each and every one of our services will have it
* HTML will be generated from RAML, so you don't have to read RAML.  Soon.

Example RAML:
https://github.com/SungevityCorp/design-platform-api/blob/develop/docs/api-docs/v1/raml/design_platform_api_v1.raml
---
# Jumping in: generating a test
* Using the stub generator
```python
        cd QA-Code/apitesting
        minion python ../general/scripts/stub.py
```

Will generate your skeleton test and write it out in the right directory.

---
# Filling In The Blanks
Each of your tests should do this:
  * add code to setUp, including the service_under_test
  * add code to your test methods.  Specifically:
    1.  perform an action with requests
    2.  check results (api response?  salesforce?)
    3.  assert that results are what you expect with hamcrest
---
# Some Examples Of Blanks Filled In
---
# A bare-bones test
:![A Bare Bones Test](barebones.png)
---
# A bit more meat on the bones -- POST, relative URLs, testrail metadata
:![A Test with auth and testrail info](auth_and_testrail.png)
---
# Genuser, and request headers for auth
:![Test with genuser and auth](genuser_and_headers.png)
---
# Executing a query from salesforce
:![Test with salesforce](salesforce.png)
---
# libraries and classes to know and love
* The class your test extends is `APITestCase`
* For submitting requests, we use the `requests` python library
* For asserting stuff, we use `pyhamcrest`
* See documentation for more details on these libraries
---
# In the APITestCase base class, some methods to know:
  * setUp
  * get_auth_headers(user, password)
  * get_user(**criteria)
  * ensure_status_code_for_response(resp, status)
  * salesforce()
  * url(path)
---
# Running your Test

example:
```python
qaetest test/design-platform/design_platform_api_test.py
```
---
# Committing and Pushing to github
```sh

         # update your repo
        git fetch

        # create your branch
        git checkout -b my_branch origin/master

        # add your test to be commmitted
        git add test/myservice/my_service_test.py

        # commit it
        git commit -m "<jira_ticket_id>: My Description"

        # push to github
        git push origin my_branch
```

---
# Tracking results in ATAT and Jenkins
* If your test fails, it'll show up on ATAT
* You can track your jenkins failure from there
