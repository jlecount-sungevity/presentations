# Intro To Python #

---
# Why Python?
* Simple language.  Easy to read and write.
* No compile step.  Makes development somewhat faster
* A number of good python libraries available especially for testing
* Cross-platform support, so tests can run on OSX, Windows, Linux without modification if one is careful

---
# An Overview of Python
---
# The Foundation
---
* python version
* tabs matter
* functions
* classes, methods and constructors
* modules
* if statements
* loops

---
# Python version

* The selenium webdriver tests use python 2.78 due to library restrictions
* The REST api tests in FuncBarn use Python 3.  
* I'd like to move the webdriver tests up to 3 but will need to modify some libraries to do this.
* Make sure you're using the right version for the right codebase.  How will be discussed.
---
# Tabs matter

Most languages don't care about how you indent your code.  

Python is not one of those languages

You use indentation where in other languages you use curly braces.  

Java example:

```java
if ( x < 5 ) {
  do_something()
}
```

In Java, by convention, you indent code but it is not mandatory.

This contrasts with python,  in which you do away with the parenthesis and the {} but must indent:

```python
if x < 5:
  do_something()
```

* We use 4 spaces to denote an indentation
* We do NOT use tab characters
* Even worse, never mix tabs with spaces.  This is actually prohibited in python 3.
---
# Functions
---

Functions may return a value or not.  
```python 
  def say_hello():
    print "Hello world"
```

In this case, print is just printing something to the screen.  It iss not a function that returns a value, it just does something.
---
# Functions that return values 
---

The 'from random' statement imports a function. More on this in a bit.


```python 
  from random import random
  def gimme_a_random_number():
    return random()

In [8]: x = gimme_a_random_number()
In [9]: print x
0.569595011496
```
---
# Classes, methods and constructors
---

Python is an object-oriented language, which means is has classes.  Classes have methods.

Methods are just functions that belong to a class.

A constructor is a special method that python calls to construct an object from your class.

Objects are instances of classes.  

```python 
class MyClass(object):

  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name

  def who_am_i(self):
    print "I am " + self.name


In [23]: c = MyClass("a class named MyClass")

In [24]: c.who_am_i()
I am a class named MyClass

```

* `__init__` is a constructor.  It creates an object by taking parameters (such as 'name') and saving them or doing something with them to set up the object

* who_am_i is a method, which is just a function attached to the object MyClass.  

* self is always the first parameter to a method of an object.  When you reference things from within the object, you prepend 'self', as in "self.name"

---
# Modules
---

A module is a bit of python code that you can pull into other code.  This allows code reuse.    Otherwise you would have to put all your python code into a single file, which would be very, very long.

Example:

Inside file random_stuff.py:
```python 

# Note this form -- we are importing the module random.  When we refer to random.choice, that is referencing a function called 'choice' inside 
# the module 'random'
import random
def random_num_string(len=10):
    return ''.join(str(random.choice(range(10))) for i in range(len))

```
Inside my_test.py:

```python 
from random_stuff import random_num_string

from holmium.core import TestCase

class MyTest(TestCase):
  def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
    super(MyTest, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

  # You do not need this method usually, just for this example.
  def runTest(self):
    self.test_default_random_string_length()

  def test_default_random_string_length(self):
    assert(len(random_num_string()) == 10 )
```

---
# Running it
---
```python 
from random_stuff import random_num_string

from holmium.core import TestCase

class MyTest(TestCase):
  def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
    super(MyTest, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

  # You do not need this method usually, just for this example.
  def runTest(self):
    self.test_default_random_string_length()

  def test_default_random_string_length(self):
    assert(len(random_num_string()) == 10 )




In [15]: m = MyTest()

In [16]: m.test_default_random_string_length()

# Returns nothing, but if it failed, you would get an exception.  
```
---

# If Statements

```python
  def browser_title_contains_google(self):
    return 'google' in self.driver.title

  def get_is_google_string(self):
    if self.browser_title_contains_google():
      return "Yes!  Yay google"
    else:
      return "No google!"
```

A few things to note:

* No parenthesis generally.  You say 'if True:', not 'if (True):'
* if statements accept any arguments.  Examples on next page
  
---

# If Statement examples

```python

# pass in a Boolean
some_value = True
if some_value:
  print "Yes"
else: 
  print "No"


# pass in a list
some_list = [ 1, 2, 3, 4]
if some_list:
  print "Yes" # Since the list is not empty, it is considered 'truthy'
else:
  print "No"


# pass in an empty list
some_list = []
if some_list:
  print "Yes"
else:
  print "No" # This prints 'No' because the list is empty.  Empty lists are considered 'falsy'
```
---

# More if statements

```python
# pass in a Boolean
some_value = None
if some_value:
  print "Yes"
else: 
  print "No"  # None means the absence of a valid value and is 'falsy'.

# pass in an Integer
some_value = 7
if some_value:
  # Integers that are not 0 are considered 'Truthy'
  print "Yes, {0} is lucky".format(some_value)
else: 
  print "No, {0} is unluckly".format(some_value)

# pass in an Integer of value 0.
some_value = 0
if some_value:
  print "Yes, {0} is lucky".format(some_value)
else: 
  # The integer value 0 is False in if statements!  
  # This is unlike many languages.  Beware.
  print "No, {0} is unluckly".format(some_value)  

```
---

# For Loops

```python
  for i in range(10):
    print i

# That prints the following:
0 
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9 
```
---

# While loops
```python
  i = 5
  while i < 10:
    i = i + 1
    print i

# That prints the following:
6
7
8
9
10
```
---

# For comprehensions

* Let's make a list of string representations of the integers from 0 to 10 exclusive, each multiplied by 2:

```python
  [str(x * 2) for x in range(10)]

Out[22]: ['0', '2', '4', '6', '8', '10', '12', '14', '16', '18']
```

You use a for comprehension when you need to apply some modification to each value in a set, then return a new set.
You can also use it to filter lists

```python
  my_name_list = ['Devi', 'Eric', 'Gagan', 'Katherine', 'Kelcey', 'Jason', 'Patrick', 'Stan' ]
  names_less_than_5_chars = [x for x in my_name_list if len(x) < 5 ]

  In [25]: print names_less_than_5_chars
  Out[25]: ['Devi', 'Eric', 'Stan']
```

# Part Two, The Python Ecosystem

* utilities in python: 
* pip for installing stuff
* virtualenv for switching python version
* nosetests for running tests
* ant for controlling it
* ipython as an interactive environment
* Intellij as an IDE

---

# Utilities

* We use the following utilities for the QA-Code python webdriver tests:

---
# pip

Pip installs python libraries.  

* Example: 'pip install selenium'

---
# virtualenv

virtualenv allows you to have multiple versions of pythons and its libraries installed on one machine.
This is used so, for example, we can  have python 3.3 and python 2.7, plus distinct versions of the various libraries we use, to
run both funcbarn and QA-Code tests
---

# nose

Not just a body part. 

Nose is a python test runner.  It:
* runs tests
* has plugins that do amazing things like drop in to the debugger upon test failure, collect profiling information on slow tests, etc
* generates test output

It also is a python library, installed via 'pip install nose'

---
# ant

All tests can be launched via ant.  

---
# ipython

ipython is an awesome REPL for python

* REPL == Read, Eval, Print, Loop
* Interactive console for running tests
* You can generate leads, iquotes, opportunities interactively
* You can drive the browser interactively via webdriver within ipython
* You can query salesforce from within ipython

---
# intellij

* Not just for Java
* The python plugin is very good
* If you don't already have an IDE you like, I recommend intellij
