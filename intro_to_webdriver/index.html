# Intro To WebDriver #

---
# What is WebDriver?
* Browser automation API
* Supports languages: Java, Ruby, C#, Python, and more
* Supports operating systems: Linux, Windows, OSX, Android, IOS
* Supports browsers: Chrome, Firefox, IE, Opera, iPhone, Android
* simulates how a USER interacts with a browser.  
* Can driver local browsers or those on another machine

---
# History
---
  Selenium began as 2 technologies: selenium-RC and selenium-IDE.

  * RC was implemented in javascript
  * IDE was a record/playback tool
  * somewhat buggy
  * limited by javascript in browser

---
# Introducing WebDriver
---

  WebDriver is written atop plugins built into browsers
  * more stable cross-browser behavior
  * interacts more consistently like a user does with the browser, not like javascript does, as in RC
  * More browser support including mobile

---
# Basic WebDriver Test
---
  
```python
  from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
  from hamcrest import is_, assert_that

  class MyWebDriverTest(UnitTest):

    def test_all_the_things(self):
      self.driver.get("http://google.com")
      search_box_element = self.driver.find_element(By.ID, "gbqfq")
      search_box_element.send_keys("wow bob wow")
      search_button = self.driver.find_element(By.NAME, "btnG")
      search_button.click()
      assert_that(self.driver.title, is_('wow bob wow - Google Search'))
```
---
# Problems
---

```python
  from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
  from hamcrest import is_, assert_that

  class MyWebDriverTest(UnitTest):

    def test_simple_search(self):
      self.driver.get("http://google.com")
      search_box_element = self.driver.find_element(By.ID, "gbqfq")
      search_box_element.send_keys("wow bob wow")
      search_button = self.driver.find_element(By.NAME, "btnG")
      search_button.click()
      assert_that(self.driver.title, is_('wow bob wow - Google Search'))
```

* Hard to maintain.  
  If you had 50 tests that tested google search and the locators changed, you'd have to change at least 50 places.
* Hard to read.  Not easy to quickly tell what's happening here.
* no way to handle alternate environments such as 'dev' or 'qa' -- URL is hard coded, etc.

---
# Answer -- PageObjects
---

```python
  from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
  from hamcrest import is_, assert_that

  class MyWebDriverTest(UnitTest):

    def test_simple_search(self):
      search_page = GoogleSearchPage(
        driver=self.driver, 
        url=self.config['google_search_url']
      )
      result_page = search_page.search_for("wow bob wow")
      assert_that(result_page.title, is_('wow bob wow - Google Search'))
```

* Consolidates page stuff with an object that subclasses a base Page
* Easier to maintain -- if locators change, you change them in one place, not in your tests
* Tests are easy to read

---
# More Benefits of Page Objects
---
# They are your API
* Page Objects are a UI-centric API to your application.  
---
# They make your tests robust
* If the specifics of the UI details change, your tests shouldn't have to
---
# Tests know what.  Pages know how
* Tests know what they want done.  Page objects know how to do it.  Don't cross those boundaries
---
# Holmium
---
# Holmium is a python PageObject library
* We use it
* I have forked the repo for extensions / bug fixes
* provides layers atop the standard webdriver 'WebElement' class.
* Supports reusable page 'sections', element lookups, much more

# Sunlenium

* Our framework
* extends holmium.core
* Adds the following:
    * environment-sensitive configuration 
    * testcase dependencies
    * cleanup of salesforce objects created during a test
    * salesforce REST integration via getters and setters.
    * interactive execution and debugging

---
# Environment-sensitive configuration
```python
  def some_test(self):
    url = self.config_value("oursungevity/url")
```
* Knows if you're in UAT, QAE, Prod
* returns right url for that env
* Generally, you don't even have to do that.  Just depend on oursungevity!  (Next slide)

# Testcase Dependencies
```python
    @requires(test_dependency.Providers.Lead, test_dependency.Providers.OurSungevityLogin)
    def test_login_to_oursungevity(self, the_lead, oursungevity):
        assert_that(oursungevity, is_not(None))
```

* That is all you need to create a new Lead and login to oursungevity as it
---
# Auto cleanup
```python
    @requires(test_dependency.Providers.Lead, test_dependency.Providers.OurSungevityLogin)
    def test_login_to_oursungevity(self, the_lead, oursungevity):
        assert_that(oursungevity, is_not(None))
```

* At the end of this test (which creates a lead), the lead is deleted in salesforce automatically.
---

# Salesforce REST integration

* Interactive example:

```python
self.person = { 'email' : "sometest1234@test.com", 'phone_number' : '(510) 867-5309' }
self.crate_lead()
Warning: No referral code given.  Using JLECOUNT
Creating a lead...
Activating lead...
Resetting password for  to zvfsagqagr
self.create_opportunity()

In [6]: self.opportunity['iQuote_Request_Date__c']
Out[6]: u'2014-09-22T20:55:36.000+0000'

In [8]: self.opportunity.populate_qa_fields()
```
---

# Interactive debugging
* interactive console using ipython
* will drop into debugger if tests have errors
* can drive the browser one step at a time from the console, just as if you were in a testcase.
